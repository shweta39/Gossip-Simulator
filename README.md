# Gossip-Simulator
As described in class Gossip type algorithms can be used both for group commu- nication and for aggregate computation. The goal of this project is to determine the convergence of such algorithms through a simulator based on actors written in F#. Since actors in F# are fully asynchronous, the particular type of Gossip implemented is the so called Asynchronous Gossip.
